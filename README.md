## What is Media Queue
Media queue is a one page app that allows a user to create an annotated list of movies and tv shows.

## Technologies used
 * React
 * OMDb api http://www.omdbapi.com

## General Approach
I've had ambitions in the past to create an app to help me keep track of movies or other media I've seen or want to see, so I wanted to use this project to create a proof of concent for a future personal project. I also felt pretty comfortable with API calls, so I wanted to focus on getting a sense of how React works.
